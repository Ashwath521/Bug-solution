function fib(n){
  let arr = [0, 1];
  for (let i = 2; i < n + 1; i++){
    arr.push(arr[i - 2] + arr[i -1])
  }
 return arr[n]
}
So notice that two first numbers can not really be effectively generated by a for loop, 
because our loop will involve adding two numbers together, so instead of creating an empty 
array we assign our arr variable to [0, 1] that we know for a fact will always be there. 
After that we create a loop that starts iterating from i = 2 and adds numbers to the array until the length of the array is equal to n + 1.
 Finally, we return the number at n index of array.
